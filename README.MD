# How to run
first go into the backend folder and do `node server.js` to start running the backend
then go to the main directory and run `npm run dev` to launch and test the frontend

you'll also need to add your mongdb access string to .env within `backend` folder under the name **MONGODB_URI**
also need the variable **JWT_SECRET** in the same .env
